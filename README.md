## About
This project is a set of automated tests to verify the functionality of API endpoints. The tests are implemented in Python using the requests library for interacting with the API and the pytest framework for organizing and running autotests.
## Install and Run

   - python3 -m venv env  # Linux  macOS
   - python -m venv venv  # Windows


   - source env/bin/activate  # Linux  macOS
   - source venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows
   
**2. Install dependencies from a file requirements.txt:**
   - python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
   - pip install -r requirements.txt

**3. To run all autotests, run the following command:**
   
   - pytest
